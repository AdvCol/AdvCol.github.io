As a result, we expect participants to go above and beyond just following listed guidelines, and seek to actively work toward conflict resolution by assuming good faith, even when discussing difficult issues, where it seems obvious that alternative opinions are just wrong.\n\nBeyond working to create a positive environment, we also expect you to:\n\n  Assume positive intent\n  Look to understand an argument you think you might disagree with before disagreeing. Ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand it before opposing it.\n  Tell participants if the way they are talking is triggering you\n  Hold onto messages that are written in passion for at least 6, and preferably 24 hours before sending them\n  Reflect others arguments in more neutral language if you see conflict happening that you can be neutral on.\n\n\nOur Responsibilities\n\nProject coordinators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable\nbehavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject coordinators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or\nreject contributions of any kind that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nScope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be\nfurther defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\nEnforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported by contacting the project team at freyley [at] gmail. All\ncomplaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that\nis deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is\nobligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.\nFurther details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good\nfaith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other\nmembers of the project’s leadership.\n\nAttribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,\navailable at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\n",

You should be their first person to ask questions of, and if there’s anything they need that we can help them with, you should help them or connect them with those who can.\n\nHow\n\nThese are sensitive subjects, and contributors are liable to have difficulty working together. We’re looking to match contributors who work well together, and we always need to check in and make sure. Be aware that contributors may have different levels of sensitivity, may communicate differently, and may need someone to arbitrate disputes.\n\nFAQ\n\n\n  What do I do first?\n\n\nWe’ll connect you with your contributors, and their topic. From there, you should make sure someone (you or them) captures a statement of their initial positions, and then you should provide them with any initial research we’ve collected for the topic. Make sure to agree on tools, and get access to whatever interim documents they create, so that we have the full record of the process. In the end, we’re going to want:\n\n  Initial position statements\n  Contributor biographies\n  A full list of research examined\n  (ideally) interpretation statements about each piece of research\n\n\n\n  My contributors are asking about finding, understanding, and interpreting research\n\n\nConnect them with a [[Research Assistant]].\n\n\n  My contributors can’t agree.\n\n\nTalk to them. Work out whether the issue is a disagreement with how pieces of research are being interpreted, or something else. If you still can’t get them to agree, bring it up with us and we’ll help you.\n\n\n  My contributors are done!\n\n\nFirst, make sure that they have agreed on at least one of the major issues at stake. Then, hand them off to an Editor to help them finalize their draft.\n",

In general, we see this as a compatibility issue, not a hard requirement. Someone who puts in a few hours a month won’t work well, probably, with someone who puts in a few hours a day.

    "title": "Techniques & Best Practices",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "There are many styles of argument and rhetoric that are not helpful for a group of people whose purpose is to learn the truth. The argument style most familiar in the West, the debate, is designed as a battle to persuade the audience, and is built on tricks and flaws in the audience’s mind.\n\nOur goal at Adversarial Collective isn’t to win arguments, it’s a process of discovery and open-minded persuasion backed by evidence, without tricks. To that end, we’re collecting here techniques designed to take you away from combat and toward discovery. Please use these techniques well - as with all tools, they can be used with pure intent or ill.\n\nThe Principle of Charity\n\nThe Principle of Charity asks you to assume that the person you disagree with is acting in good faith, and has reasons to believe what they do, reasons that are worth understanding.\n\nSteelman\n\nThe opposite of the Strawman fallacy. If you assume The Principle of Charity, when your adversary makes an argument, it is your responsibility to understand their argument in the strongest possible light, and then to argue against its strongest form. Pretend you were making their argument, and then make it better, and only then, when you have made it as strong as you can, is it fair to point out its flaws.\n\nTaboo your words\n\nWhen disagreeing with someone, there’s a good chance that your disagreement hinges upon the definitions of some of the words you are using. Try to identify one of those words and ban it from the discussion, forcing you and your adversary to define your argument more precisely, and often helping you discover how you differ.\n\nReflective listening\n\nFew people want to listen to someone who is not listening to them. When emotions are strong, help your adversary understand that you are listening to them by reflecting what they are saying with different words, so that they know that you not just hear, but understand them.\n\nThe Fundamental Attribution Error\n\nWhen you punch a wall, you know that you are doing so because of a recent anger-causing circumstance. When you see someone else punch a wall, you assume that it is because they are an angry person. Assume that someone’s beliefs and emotions are beliefs and emotions, rather than traits or aspects.\n\nCalling someone a racist/sexist/homophobe/etc\n\nIt’s very difficult to be called a racist or other negatively slanted permanent trait. Calling someone racist is a good way to shut down the conversation. In the context of a conversation where you’re acting according to the Principle of Charity, it is better to instead, point out, gently, that the particular thing they said seems racist to you, and why. This gives them an opportunity to consider that, and allows the conversation to continue and both of you to learn.\n\nSeparate Exploration from Disagreement\n\nBefore you disagree, clarify. Seeking to understand before you disagree helps you with all of the above.\n\nEvidence\n\nWhen making a claim, especially a controversial claim, expect to be asked for evidence. Expect the evidence to be evaluated not just for its conclusion, but for its methods, its investigators’ biases, and other potential issues with it. Weak evidence is still evidence, and should be weighed based on its strength, not discarded.\n\nAsk for evidence for anything you disagree with. Be kind and polite when asking for evidence.\n\nIn the event that you cannot find evidence that is strong enough to satisfy you, describe what evidence would satisfy you.\n\nRemember that evidence that is weak may still be stronger than the evidence of your experience that you are presumably relying upon if you lack anything else.\n\nAbsence of evidence, if there’s reason to believe that investigation has occurred, is evidence of absence. For example, the lack of leprechaun videos on YouTube is evidence of a lack of leprechauns, given how much video is on YouTube.\n\nDifferentiate between a lack of evidence for something, and a lack of investigation of something. An absence of evidence is meaningless if no one appears to have investigated a topic.\n\nCorrelation can imply causation, but only when the math is done carefully, and it does not always imply causation in the direction that you assume. Spurious correlations are everywhere, especially in a culture that encourages publish or perish.\n\n",
