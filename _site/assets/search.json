You should be their first person to ask questions of, and if there’s anything they need that we can help them with, you should help them or connect them with those who can.\n\nHow\n\nThese are sensitive subjects, and contributors are liable to have difficulty working together. We’re looking to match contributors who work well together, and we always need to check in and make sure. Be aware that contributors may have different levels of sensitivity, may communicate differently, and may need someone to arbitrate disputes.\n\nFAQ\n\n\n  What do I do first?\n\n\nWe’ll connect you with your contributors, and their topic. From there, you should make sure someone (you or them) captures a statement of their initial positions, and then you should provide them with any initial research we’ve collected for the topic. Make sure to agree on tools, and get access to whatever interim documents they create, so that we have the full record of the process. In the end, we’re going to want:\n\n  Initial position statements\n  Contributor biographies\n  A full list of research examined\n  (ideally) interpretation statements about each piece of research\n\n\n\n  My contributors are asking about finding, understanding, and interpreting research\n\n\nConnect them with a [[Research Assistant]].\n\n\n  My contributors can’t agree.\n\n\nTalk to them. Work out whether the issue is a disagreement with how pieces of research are being interpreted, or something else. If you still can’t get them to agree, bring it up with us and we’ll help you.\n\n\n  My contributors are done!\n\n\nFirst, make sure that they have agreed on at least one of the major issues at stake. Then, hand them off to an Editor to help them finalize their draft.\n",

Does it affect you personally, or a loved one, or do you have another reason it’s important your partner be sensitive about?\n  How much time do you foresee committing to this project?\n  Along what sort of schedule?\n\n\n(Looking for more)\n",

In general, we see this as a compatibility issue, not a hard requirement. Someone who puts in a few hours a month won’t work well, probably, with someone who puts in a few hours a day. But there’s no reason a few hours a month, or a burst of a few days at the end of every semester, or any other schedule can’t work, as long as the partners are aligned.\n\n",

    "content": "Who\n\nWe seek to discover the truth about topics where currently, different groups hold different opinions based in different evidence.\n\nWe are a volunteer group with a mission of learning about, documenting, and advocating for a position on topics of fact and policy. Often these topics are controversial, though we do not require that a topic to be controversial to consider it, only that it have significant support for multiple competing beliefs\n\nHow\n\nWe impanel a small group of passionate volunteers to work together on a topic, first researching, then reviewing and discussing the research, and finally writing a statement regarding the topic. Written statements will contain statements of values that may affect the conclusions you draw, evaluations of the evidence presented, a list of evidence that the group feels is insufficient or lacking, and conclusions that the group drew. Where necessary, there may also be statements regarding the remaining disagreement.\n\nWe are inspired by Adversarial Collaborations, but are focused on reviewing the research rather than performing new experiments, and by City Club of Portland’s Research Committees, but are working to make this available to a globally distributed audience, and focus.\n\nThe research group works together via asynchronous, and where possible, synchronous internet text, audio, and video chat, email, shared documents, etc. We do not expect participants to be colocated, and expect to work around timezones.\n\nWe welcome suggested topics from anywhere. You can suggest a topic that we should review [here].\n\nWe welcome volunteers to research topics as well. You can sign up to volunteer for our currently listed topics [here]. Our ideal volunteer is willing to put in an average of 2-3 hours a week for the duration of the topic.\n\n",
