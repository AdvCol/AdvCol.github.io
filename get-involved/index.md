### Adversaries

As an adversary, you're volunteering to assist with a research topic as part of a group of people who come from different perspectives on the topic.

Please [sign up to volunteer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/research-volunteer-form.md %}) for our currently listed topics.

In an effort to not keep our volunteers waiting, we review topics and volunteers on a rolling basis, with the aim to impanel a new policy jury as soon as we have the right members. Our next review cycle ends **30 March 2019**. Please sign up before then!
