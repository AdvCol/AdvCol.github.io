We're delighted you're interested in helping out. Here are the roles that make this work.

### Adversaries

As an adversary, you're volunteering to assist with a research topic as part of a group of people who come from different perspectives on the topic. Ideally, you're able to put in an average of 2 hours per week for the duration of the topic. Please sign up for our currently listed topics. 

[volunteer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/research-volunteer-form.md %}){:class="cta"} 

In an effort to not keep our volunteers waiting, we review topics and volunteers on a rolling basis, with the aim to impanel a new research jury as soon as we have the right members. Our next review cycle ends **30 April 2019**. Please sign up before then!

### Research Experts

Are you an expert in [one of the topics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/current-topics.md %}) that we're currently interested in, or a general purpose researcher who can assist us across a variety of topics? We'd [love to hear from you.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/research-expert-form.md %})

### Other

As an entirely volunteer project, we'd love your help or ideas. 

* [Ideas for new topics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/topic-form.md %})
* [Research you've found]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/research-form.md %}) on any of the [the topics that we're currently considering]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/current-topics.md %})
