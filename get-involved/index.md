There are many ways that you can get involved.

Before you start, we strongly encourage reading [about us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about/index.md %}).

## Volunteer

The most important way you can help is by volunteering to assist with a research topic. You can [sign up to volunteer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/research-volunteer-form.md %}) for our currently listed topics. Our ideal volunteer is willing to put in an average of 2-3 hours a week for the duration of the topic.

## Topics

You can check out our [list of topics](https://airtable.com/shrjkbDuQ0V4HoMQY/tblXpuIXMphuMHHAg)

We welcome suggested topics from anywhere. If you have an idea for a topic that we haven't listed, go ahead and [suggest it to us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/topic-form.md %}).

## Research

See a topic that you know something about? We'd love to hear about [any research you think we should know about]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/research-form.md %}).

## Coordination, marketing, etc

Want to help out in other ways? We'd love to talk to you. Join the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/jW3PSVQ) and tell us how you'd like to help.
