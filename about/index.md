We seek to discover the truth about topics where currently, different groups hold different opinions based in different evidence.

We are a volunteer group with a mission of learning about, documenting, and advocating for a position on topics of fact and policy. Often these topics are controversial, though we do not require that a topic to be controversial to consider it, only that it have significant support for multiple competing beliefs 

## How does it work?

We impanel a small group of passionate volunteers to work together on a topic, first researching, then reviewing and discussing the research, and finally writing a statement regarding the topic. Written statements will contain statements of values that may affect the conclusions you draw, evaluations of the evidence presented, a list of evidence that the group feels is insufficient or lacking, and conclusions that the group drew. Where necessary, there may also be statements regarding the remaining disagreement.

We are inspired by [Adversarial Collaborations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_collaboration), but are focused on reviewing the research rather than performing new experiments, and by City Club of Portland's [Research Committees](https://www.pdxcityclub.org/research/), but are working to make this available to a globally distributed audience, and a broader set of topics.

The research group works together via asynchronous, and where possible, synchronous internet text, audio, and video chat, email, shared documents, etc. We do not expect participants to be colocated, and expect to work around timezones.

## Interested in helping out?

The most important way you can help is by volunteering to assist with a research topic. You can [sign up to volunteer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-involved/research-volunteer-form.md %}) for our currently listed topics. Our ideal volunteer is willing to put in an average of 2-3 hours a week for the duration of the topic.
