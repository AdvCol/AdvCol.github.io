## What

You are someone who:
* Wants to spend some time really deeply understanding a topic
* Has a strong opinion about it already, formed from the zeitgeist or your previous research
* Is willing to work with a partner or partners who disagree with you

## How

1. Let us know that you're interested, and what topics you're interested in working on.
2. We will ask you [some questions](Contributor-Qualification.md) to determine who you would best be set to work with.
3. A [Contributor Coordinator](Contributor-Coordinator.md) will connect you with a partner or partners.
4. You'll research the topic, read the research that your partners and the [[Research Assistant]] find, seek to understand the topic as well as possible.
5. You'll discuss with your partners until you reach conclusions that you can agree on.
6. You'll write those down as a paper, working with the Editor.

## FAQ

> Who do I ask ...?

All questions should be directed to your Adversary Coordinator.

> How much time will this require?

That's one of our questions for you! In general, we see this as a compatibility issue, not a hard requirement. Someone who puts in a few hours a month won't work well, probably, with someone who puts in a few hours a day. But there's no reason a few hours a month, or a burst of a few days at the end of every semester, or any other schedule _can't_ work, as long as the partners are aligned.
