title: AdvCol Code of Conduct
---


## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and coordinators pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, political opinion or ideology. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

As a volunteer with the Adversarial Collective, you will be exposed to people who strongly disagree with you, possibly about topics which you care deeply about, or are personally meaningful to you. As a result, we expect participants to go above and beyond just following listed guidelines, and seek to actively work toward conflict resolution by assuming good faith, even when discussing difficult issues, where it seems obvious that alternative opinions are just wrong. 

Beyond working to create a positive environment, we also expect you to:
* Assume positive intent
* Look to understand an argument you think you might disagree with before disagreeing. Ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand it before opposing it.
* Tell participants if the way they are talking is triggering you
* Hold onto messages that are written in passion for at least 6, and preferably 24 hours before sending them
* Reflect others arguments in more neutral language if you see conflict happening that you can be neutral on.

## Our Responsibilities

Project coordinators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project coordinators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject contributions of any kind that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at freyley [at] gmail. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
