## What

Your mission is to help the [Contributors](Contributor.md) complete their research, discussion, and writing. You should be their first person to ask questions of, and if there's anything they need that we can help them with, you should help them or connect them with those who can. 

## How

These are sensitive subjects, and contributors are liable to have difficulty working together. We're looking to match contributors who work well together, and we always need to check in and make sure. Be aware that contributors may have different levels of sensitivity, may communicate differently, and may need someone to arbitrate disputes. 

## FAQ

> What do I do first?

We'll connect you with your contributors, and their topic. From there, you should make sure someone (you or them) captures a statement of their initial positions, and then you should provide them with any initial research we've collected for the topic. Make sure to agree on tools, and get access to whatever interim documents they create, so that we have the full record of the process. In the end, we're going to want:
* Initial position statements
* Contributor biographies
* A full list of research examined
* (ideally) interpretation statements about each piece of research

> My contributors are asking about finding, understanding, and interpreting research

Connect them with a [[Research Assistant]].

> My contributors can't agree.

Talk to them. Work out whether the issue is a disagreement with how pieces of research are being interpreted, or something else. If you still can't get them to agree, bring it up with us and we'll help you.

> My contributors are done!

First, make sure that they have agreed on at least one of the major issues at stake. Then, hand them off to an Editor to help them finalize their draft.
