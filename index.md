Adversarial Collective is a volunteer effort to pursue the truth in areas where significant controversy exists.

Groups hold different opinions for a variety of reasons, including culture, history, different experiences and evidence. These disagreements aren't easy to solve, but they divide and hurt us, and with care and respect we can bridge some divides, and better understand others. 

Adversarial Collective builds policy juries, to bring together people with largely different views on a subject and encourage and enable them to investigate, evaluate, and document the current state of the topic, whenever possible searching for respect, agreement and future avenues of research.
