Adversarial Collective is a volunteer effort to pursue the truth where major controversy exists. We aim to do this by arranging adversarial collaborations. We help people who disagree with each other on a subject find each other. Those people collaborate to summarize the research surrounding the topic. Each group tries to come to an agreement about as much of their subject as they can.

Groups hold different opinions for a variety of reasons. People from different backgrounds often have different reasons to believe what they believe. These disagreements aren't easy to solve, but they divide and hurt us. With care and respect we can bridge some of these divides and better understand each other.

Please check the links below if you're interested in taking part in a collaboration, suggesting a topic for a collaboration, or volunteering to help keep the project running smoothly.
